# My Excel scripts

## What do these scripts do?
- These scripts are an attempt to reduce my efforts with Excel sheets (a small step towards automating this stuff)

## Why?
Simply: Laziness
Detailed: Whenever I wrote something in my money-related spreadsheets I wondered if I could simply pull data from available sources instead of typing. So this is an attempt towards the same stuff


Currently includes:   
1. Script to extract basic data from a credit card statement (not much but helps me with data maintenance)


Planned stuff:  
(Priority) - Node XLSX (sheetjs) service for CRUD operations
1. Script to extract every transaction detail from credit card statements
2. Script to extract transaction details from bank statements
3. Stocks related (still finding a proper use case)

### Current tech stack
- Node JS - [XLSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx), [pdf-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse)
